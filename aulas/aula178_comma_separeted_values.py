# CSV (Comma separeted Values)
# It's a file format that stores data in a tabular form, where each line represents a row of the table, and the columns are separeted by commas. It is widely used to transfer data between different spreadsheets systems (Google Sheets, Excel, LibreOffice Calc) or to a database.
# A CSV file typically has the ".csv" extension and can be opened in a text editor or a spreadsheet program.
# An example of a CSV file can be:
# Name, Age, adress
# Ailton F Silva, 28, "Rue Pde Anchieta, 221, Centre"
# Maria de F F De Almeida, 52, "Julio Mario Salusse, 101"

# The file first line define the columns names, while the following lines contain the row values, separeted by commas.
# Simple CSV Rules:
# 1. Separate column values with a single deimites (,)
